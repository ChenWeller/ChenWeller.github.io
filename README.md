# 👋 Welcome to Chen Weller's GitHub!

## About Me
I am a direct Ph.D. candidate in the **Molecular Cell Biology Department** at the **Weizmann Institute of Science**, working under the mentorship of **Prof. Yardena Samuels**. My research focuses on **cancer immunology**, particularly **mRNA translation regulation** and **MHC-mediated antigen presentation** by cancer cells.

🔬 My work explores how translation dysregulation in tumor cells generates novel **targetable antigens**. Using **immunopeptidomics, genomics, and functional assays**, I aim to uncover the intricate link between translation fidelity, tumor immunogenicity and the immunopeptidome landscape.

## Research & Skills
- **Techniques**: Immunopeptidomics, CRISPR genome editing, functional T-cell assays, next-generation sequencing
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical modeling, survival analysis, computational mass spectrometry
- **Computational Focus**: Developing tools to dissect the cancer cell **immunopeptidome**
